# grapevine-leaves-classification
We use the Grapevine Leaves Image Dataset to identify different types of vine leaves. 

Project Description

- Divide the data into training and test data with a ratio of 80 to 20.
- You can increase the number of images by using data augmentation. Be careful that the test data should not be from augmented data. Therefore, first, convert the data into two parts, test and training, and Augment the train part. After applying the augmentation of the training data, use 20 percent of the data as validation.
